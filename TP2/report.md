## 3.2.2

1. The Faces are filled with Solid. The shadows are missing.
2. The Sphere has more/less vertices in on the meridians/parallels when changing the two parameters.

## 3.2.3

1. The view streches in order to fit the image when we resize the window. To preserve the aspect ratio, we have to always have the same proportions between the height and width.

## 4.2.1

1. The field of view is changed, that means we either see the teapot bigger or smaller, because the angle is bigger/smaller and that make the picture appear more zoomed in/out.
2. When changing zNear, the teapot get cut with zNear > 2.1.

## 4.2.2

1. The teapot appears its head down.
2. In the first view, to get the right up vector, we put it along the x-axis to fit the "teapot axis". In the second one, we have to put two fields to ±1.0, so that the angle is 45°.
